final project:
individual project:
a game in which you collect clean rain drops but avoid dirty ones
functions:
    the character moves with your mouse
    different rain drops fall from the top of the screen at random
    every 20 drops form a level
    when at a higher level, the water falls at a greater speed
Dear Angel:  This sounds like a great idea for a program. You may use Pygame to design your program.  Take a few pygame tutorials to begin!
