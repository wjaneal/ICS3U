Final Project
I would like to make a pygame about music to help people to relax.In this game,
there are some bubbles floating in the screen one by one and a little cat.This
little cat should jump in the bubble step by step with the rhythm.three degrees
are presented,purr,meow and bang(purr means perfect,meaw means great,bang means
bad and the cat will fall down).When the music is over or the cat falls down,
game is over.These degrees are judged by the time range or the distance range.
In China,there have been some music game such as Deemo and Cytus to be a
reference.   

Dear Aeon:  This sounds like a great idea.  Please take a pygame tutorial to get started.
